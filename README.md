    - Lemmatization / Stemming
4. **Vectorization** (Convert Text data into Vectors):
    - Bag Of Words (CountVectorizer)
    - TF-IDF
5. **Model Building**:
    - Model Object Initialization
    - Train and Test Model
6. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Accuracy Score
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Classification Report
7. **Model Deployment**
8. **Prediction on Client Data**
